# friend-or-freeze
Regional Twitter Sentiment Analyzer
by Lee Broxson, John Shaff, and Maelle Vance

Ever want to see what kind of day you're going to have? How happy the people in your area are at any present time? friend-or-freeze will elicit a positive, negative, or neutral outcome based upon a set of tweets specific to the zip code the user inputs. With our Twitter sentiment 'touchstone', the app can analyze a number of tweets and produce an outcome for the user to let them know whether they'll make a friend...or whether it's going to be cold out there today! 

Project deployed at: https://friend-or-freeze.herokuapp.com/
